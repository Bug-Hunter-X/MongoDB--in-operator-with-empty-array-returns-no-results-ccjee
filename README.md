# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates an uncommon MongoDB error related to the `$in` operator used with an empty array.  The query `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` always results in an empty result set, regardless of the data in the collection.  This is because MongoDB interprets the empty array as a condition that no document can satisfy. 

The solution provided addresses this issue by first checking if the array is empty, ensuring the query only executes if a valid array is passed.
